# Results

1. Random Forest Regressor worked better than other regression algorithms like linear regression,logistic regression 
2. Random Forest Regressor without hyperparameter tuning resulted in score of 65
3. For improvement of results hyperparameter tuning was done which resulted in score of 89.99

Final improved model resulted in the rank of 139 on the leaderboard
